# CodeAlpha_Iris_Flower_Classification

This project uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The classification is based on four features of each flower: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Models Used
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Logistic Regression
* Each model is trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy and precision. Cross-validation and grid search help optimize model performance.

## Workflow
* Data Preparation: Load, scale, and split data into training and testing sets.
* Model Training: Train multiple classifiers and evaluate on test data.
* Comparison: Identify the best-performing model for accurate classification.

## Dataset
The dataset has:
### Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
### Classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
